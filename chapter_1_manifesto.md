**Team PSD Scientific Values** guide additional **Participatory** and **Open Science** principles:
- **Participatory Research** encourages us to **co-create our scientific research**. Therefore...
- We **share decisions**, which requires a high level of **documentation.** 
- We seek greater **equity** among partners in how collaborate, which requires **responsive pivots** with new stakeholder inputs.
- We strive use **transparent** and **accessible** processes and platforms, and develop **transparent, accessible resources**.

**Team PSD Project Management Principles**

- **NOTE: Team PSD Scientific Values guide _how_ and _why_ we synthesize the approaches below**

**Team PSD integrates Waterfall** principles because:
- We are a **research team** that cannot deviate in quality, scope, timeline or cost from our thoroughly developed and vetted **research plan**
- Therefore, there are several **well-defined scientific requirements** where change cannot occur - unless the PI and co-I senior scientists advise an operational definition or implementation detail is within the scope of the federally funded and registered, scientifically peer-reviewed, and VA ORD and Stanford IRB reviewed procedures.

**Team PSD integrates Agile** principles because:
- Our research team’s method is a an implementation of **participatory system dynamics** in a national production environment.
- These methods **historically have iterated in-person** locally. 
- Our innovation is local priorities, local data and local insights at national scale, made possible using **online platforms** and **virtual processes**.

**Team PSD integrates Waterfall and Agile** principles because:
- We are using a funded **a priori research design** (Waterfall) to **study** an **implementation science** (Agile) problem.
- Producing generalizable knowledge requires implementation scientists to **follow and report publicly** progress completing a **rigorous, replicable plan** (Waterfall)
- However, the context is not a tightly controlled laboratory, rather we are **working with operational partners** to **implement our innovation** the dynamic context of real world healthcare operations (Agile)

**Team PSD integrates Lean** principles because:
- Team PSD **_processes_** are assessed for continuous improvement (kaizen/muda elimination)
- Team PSD **_communication_** is designed to reduce rework (muda/waste)
- Team PSD encourages **_minimum viable products_** to find and synthesize team and partner expertise (just-in-time) 
- Team PSD **_platforms_** are designed to increase visual production controls (kanban/signboard; andon alerts)
- Note: VA uses Lean as a primary approach to healthcare quality improvement.

**Team PSD integrates Scrum** principles because:
- We need to be able keep work produced by our t**ransdisciplinary research team** on the same page with our **cross-functional team**.
- Therefore, we use **sprints** (epics/milestones)so that the **team priorities** can be aligned/re-aligned efficiently.
- We also use **workgroup leads** (scrum masters), **workgroups** (owners) and **workgroup** meetings to benefit from the efficiency of **divvying up/delegating**, while also identifying **dependencies** and remove **blocks**.
- We use **GitHub/ZenHub** and **daily huddles** to assign, scope, prioritize, manage and review our capacity, requirements, estimates - this includes **Project Kanbans, Issue Cards, Pipelines & Reporting**.

**Team PSD Pain points we are working to better address**:
- Need &&tight collaboration without unnecessary overhead,** so **culture of participation** is maintained
- Need **rapid iterations that prototype,** check early, and **synthesize input**from key stakeholders as efficiently as possible, so we aren’t pulled in wasteful directions or adding unnecessary **rework**
- Need a **standard set of principles and processes,** so our **production platforms** are **stable at scale.**

**Continuous Collaborative Iteration Cycles (e.g., “DevOps”)**
- SOP > Workgroup Meetings > Monthly Priorities > Requirements gathering standardization for features
- Tools for team members to understand cross-functional “stakes” efficiently 
- “Continuous integration” to avoid “merge conflicts” - _Quotes are meant to clarify that we have this problem at a communication and conceptual level, not just a code level._ **We need the code level next...because...**
- Ideally...**testing,** **deploying** and **documenting** would be increasingly automated.
- REALLY need continuous documentation and training.
