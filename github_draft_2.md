## Style
We use R Markdown format for syntax and style which you can refer to here (ADD HYPERLINK). Use a human and computer readable format to name files, meaning all lowercase, underscores, and dates (as necesary) with a name that will be meaningful to whoever reads it. 

We will update with links to style guides.

## ZenHub for Project Management

###  Upload Files
To upload files, choose the branch or folder you want and upload the file. The file will be named as it was in your computer, so make sure to give the file a name according that is simple and reflective of its contents to anyone that reads the file name.

Files cannot be downloaded individually - you have to download the entire branch.  You can find the green "Download" button on the main page of each branch.
