## 1. What is Microsoft SQL Server

MTL team uses the **Microsoft SQL Server DBMS (Database Management System)** as well as the **SQL (Structured Query Language)** to work with data. As such, a fundamental understanding of SQL Server and SQL is helpful.

Microsoft SQL Server is a software product with the primary function of storing and retrieving data as requested by other software applications, which may run either on the same computer or on another computer across a network.


## 2. SQL Server Structure in a Nutshell

A **Schema** in a SQL database is a collection of logical structures of data. The schema is owned by a database user and has the same name as the database user. From SQL Server 2005, a schema is an independent entity (container of objects) different from the user who creates that object.

## 3. SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) - Logging on
**SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** is the Microsoft SQL Server utility for configuring, managing and administering database components. It includes a script editor and a graphics program that works with server objects and settings. The main tool of SQL Server Management Studio is Object Explorer, which allows a user to view, retrieve, and manage server objects. **SSMS has to be installed on your machine**.

## 4. SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) - After Login   

**Database Schema** is a collection of database objects including tables, views, triggers, stored procedures, indexes, etc. A schema is associated with a username which is known as the schema owner, who is the owner of the logically related database objects.

A schema always belongs to one database. On the other hand, a database may have one or multiple schemas. An object within a schema is qualified using the schema_name.object_name format like. Two objects (e.g. tables) in two schemas can have the same name so you may have schema_1.table_1 and schema_2.table_1.

## 5. What Is SQL  

SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system, or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system. 
There are five types of SQL Commands which can be classified as:

- DDL (Data Definition Language) – CREATE 
- DML (Data Manipulation Language) – INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
- DQL (Data Query Language) - SELECT
- DCL (Data Control Language) – GRANT 
- TCL (Transaction Control Language) - COMMIT, ROLLBACK and SAVEPOINT

Although SQL follows ANSI standards, each SQL database vendor may also add its own features and procedural languages to the standard SQL. **Power Users mostly interact with SQL’s DQL, DDL and DML.**
 
## 6. SQL Commands in a Nutshell

## 7. SQL DQL, DDL and DML

### SYNTAX
- [SELECT](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/select-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15)
- [UPDATE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/update-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15) 
- [INSERT](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/insert-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15) 
- [DELETE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/delete-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15) 
- [CREATE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/create-table-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15) 


## 8. SQL Server Data Types

A basic understanding of SQL Server data types is necessary when creating table objects in SQL Server.

## 10.  SQL DQL

## 11.  SQL JOIN Types

The extent of the overlap, if any, is determined by how many records in Table 1 (T1) match the records in Table 2 (T2). Depending on what subset of data we would like to select from the two tables, the four join types can be visualized by highlighting the corresponding sections of the Venn diagram:

- INNER JOIN (or just JOIN): Only records that match exactly between the two tables 
- LEFT JOIN: All records on the left + matched records on the right
- RIGHT JOIN: All records on the right + matched records on the left
- FULL OUTER JOIN: Every record from both (even if they have no match)

**Please note that if a JOIN is not used between two tables a Cartesian Product is produced, which is most cases in not the desired output.**

## 12. SQL DML - UPDATE

![SQL_10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39805164/80838084-06541c00-8bad-11ea-841a-288d26a87250.png)

## 13. SQL DML - DELETE

![SQL_11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39805164/80838327-a1e58c80-8bad-11ea-9ac8-cc0a30ffc37c.png)

## 14. SQL DML - INSERT

![SQL_12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39805164/80838613-4c5daf80-8bae-11ea-9336-66f99b66d1a1.png)

## 15. SQL SERVER TEMPORARY Tables

SQL Server **Temporary** tables are prefixed by a **"#"** character. They have a single session lifetime, which means they are dropped when the session ends. They can be used as intermediate steps in very large SQL scripts to reduce complexity.
