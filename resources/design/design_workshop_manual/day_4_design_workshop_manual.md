## Day 4: Team PSD 2.0

- 10AM today: **Post Cognitive Interviews results for TEST 1 and for TEST 2 to Teams**
- 1PM today: **#1192 & #1220 & Dependency Post-Mortems in the language of CI**

**“Song” for building the Railroad...Metaphor**

- **Gandy Dancers** used their songs to build the railroads for well over 150 years.
- And, railroads supported other development, innovation and wealth (e.g. Stanford University).
- But, not only were gandy dancers ultimately replaced, the railways themselves in large-part were ultimately were **technologically outgrown** (i.e., is Stanford known as one of the most prominent railroad universities in the world?)

**Team PSD is outgrowing our unscalable workflow!**

   - **We will learn this together (mutual learning) as we always do :)**

**_How sure am I that we have to better integrate existing coding standards to survive?_**

**A. The _threat_: Our only cover is daylight.**

**Part 1: Look at how normed this is...**

- **COVID19 Modeling Uncertainty - All available, but “wrong” vs...**
- **COVID19 Pre-prints, Communication Response Time & Data Availability - Not available**
- **COVID-19 Open Science Framework Example (normed)**

**Part 2: We have a way forward…many grants cannot continue and staff are being furloughed.**

**B. The _opportunity_: The community is there to support us finding our TeamPSD “songs.”**

**Look at how normed this is...**

1. **Quick Start Guides**
https://developer.github.com/apps/quickstart-guides/using-the-github-api-in-your-app/
2. **Support** 
https://support.github.com/
3. **Probot Repo**
https://github.com/probot/probot
4. **Virtual Conferences** 
https://githubsatellite.com/schedule/

**C. Put in a values consistent way: We are the Leads in this space and people want to know how they can do this too!**

- The list of mentees, senior scientist that want to retrain and partners that want to help is **long**…

**We are using 7 Team PSD user _personas_ to test native GitHub Continuous Integration _prototypes_:**

- Reviewing Cognitive Interview results elicited **_diverse mental models_ about the prototype _training_ and the prototype _capabilities_**.

*These were all present before our workshop, we are trying to gain new **empathic understanding** of each user type.

- **Huge time-savings!** Reported range for GH Apps **1.5 - 3 hours** inclusive of cognitive interviewing.

**User Point of View (POV) Problem Statement, Team PSD doesnʼt scale.**

- Team Personas
- Team Position Description (PDs)

**Design Workshop “TO BE” Key Words:**

1. **“Automate”**
2. **“Shared language”**
3. **“See/Test”**
4. **“Integrate”** (simplify)
5. **“Increase time for/Focus** on transparent Team PSD Science” (not just our MTL intervention)

**Design Workshop “AS IS” Key Words**

1. Not using our **tools/platform** correctly, why? The team doesnʼt know how...
2. ***Upskill, so we can**

- **“Speak the same language!”** Learn more about our diverse Team PSD user-types and their mental models.
- **“Google for yourself”** - Use of existing standards are empowering! time-saving!
- **“Simplify to existing standards”** - Key to onboarding new members & staying current to collaborate, retain funding.

**Generally (Macro)**: Upskilling refers to the expansion of team memberʼs capabilities and employability to fulfill team needs in a rapidly changing economy (e.g. OSF, COVID-19 & the scientific landscape).

**Specifically (Micro)**: Upskilling is not the same as reskilling...An upskilling effort, is a comprehensive initiative to convert, and further develop, applicable team knowledge into more productive team results.

**Coming out of this workshop, our may_epic priority is the Team PSD 2.0 release** (#1192 & #1220), with **_critical focus on wrapping up the R21_**

These are our steps:

1. **Clarify why** the team needs new skills,
2. **Identify the skills** that are most valuable,
3. **Develop the most feasible/viable plan for how** the team will obtain the necessary skills, using our personas
- _Prototypes_:
a. _generic GitHub_ prototypes,
b.	followed by top-priority _Team PSD-specific_ prototypes next week
4. **Train to scientific and industry standard skills** through technology-enabled learning in the existing coding/GitHub ecosystem
5. **Synthesize into a new “root” Team PSD repo (SOP continuously integrated, deployed and documented; manual & document tracker)**

Our **Team PSD Manual Design Thinking Workshop** is confronting our individual assumptions to design better solutions.

- The payoff can be immense in **team results**,
- overall **quality of work life**, and
- increased **individual and team opportunities**.

**Thursday & Friday Outline**

**“Thereʼs an app for that!”**

**1192 & Dependent Issues Process Post-Mortem**

**Using new shared GitHub “CI” language/understanding, how might we (HMW)**

- a) **enlist a native GH feature to solve 80% of our pain** (upstream & downstream?),
- b) what can be and should be done in **May**?
- c) **who will learn what new skills** to develop the Team PSD-specific prototype for user testing? Why?
- d) what is the **user-centered hypothesisv you are trying to reject/validate with your prototype (minimal viable product or “MVP”)

**1220 & Dependent Issues Process Post-Mortem**

**Using new shared GitHub “CI” language/understanding, how might we (HMW)**

- a) **enlist a native GH feature to solve 80% of our pain** (upstream & downstream?),
- b) what can be and should be done in **May**?
- c) **who will learn what new skill**s to develop the Team PSD-specific prototype for user testing? Why?
- d) what is the **user-centered hypothesis** you are trying to reject/validate with your prototype (minimal viable product or “MVP”)
- e) what **metrics** will we use next week to evaluate our _user-centered hypotheses_ about our _Team PSD-specific prototypes_?

**Friday Finalize**

One pager of what we are doing in the team

- Language map 
  - Git
  - YAML Node.js
  - CSS Docker
  - .html
  - .sql
  - .r

**Repo map:**

- **Everything MTL “mtl” describe, detail** (Sim UI, SEE & SAY, Models, model & data documentarian) (1220) - 100% open source (get the help!)
- **Everything Team PSD** - team **document** _how_ to “teampsd” (1192) - 100% “living document” and “self-help”
- Team PSD Open Science **disseminate** scientists & VA???
- **mtl_code** plus OSF (research scientists?)
- **Internal VA Enterprise** (operations VA)
- **teampsd** - set up SOP build for repo

What should we do first, why?

- capabilities

Who needs to learn what?

- training

What metrics will we use next week to evaluate our user-centered hypotheses about our Team PSD-specific prototypes?
