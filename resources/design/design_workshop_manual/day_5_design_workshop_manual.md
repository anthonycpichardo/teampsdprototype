## Day 5: Team PSD Personas and Minimum Viable Products (MVPs)

8AM: Part I & II Together

9AM: Part III & IV On your own

12:30: Check-in

2-4PM: Part V Review and Clarify next steps together

**Part I:**

**Using the GitHub Continuous Integration (CI) language today.**

**A. What is the purpose of a shared language?**

Shared understanding.

**Who has translated between two languages before. What are the challenges? What does it feel like (ups & downs) to be a translator?**

**B. Artifacts from Day 4**

- **P.I. Persona (& Platform Manager)**: Knew we needed to be headed to end-
to-end open science-workflow and **both have the mental model that we have been headed here the whole time.** [clouds]
- PI knows (knew) that **we have team members who understand that a teamʼs full use of continuous integration (CI) and deployment (CD) and/or GitHub is so basic** for people who do what we do, that the fact that we do not have this in place is demoralizing and alarming!
- But, PI did not realize that we also **have some team members still just grasping this reality due to lack having the shared language and understanding** of these standard capabilities.

**P.I.: Wants the team to be resourceful and responsible for learning together how to align Team PSD according to existing standards.**

**Part II:

No, really...we must use the GitHub Continuous Integration (CI) language _TODAY_. And, we must continue to use our _user personas to test our assumptions_.**

**A. *WHY is it _urgent_ that we retain our user persona POV as we move into our HMW (how might we) MVP learning, development & testing?**

- **We must locate ourselves in our team of users and assume we are**

a) HIGHLY likely to not really be understanding each personas WHYs, and 

b) not really understanding the GitHub/CI standard HOWs.

**B. Review this “HOW” and “WHY” Exchange from end of the day 4:**

**P.I.** (Lindsey):

- “Well, **SQL Programmer/Data Engineer persona** (Ash) thatʼs an important point.
- But, thatʼs not quite what **Principal Investigator** (I) meant for the about the **order of file standards** vs setting up **actions**, in what I heard our **Data Analyst/Technical Writer** (Anthony) proposing for him that I think may also save a ton of **HQ workgroup time in May**...
- [**Principal Investigator** clarification with **SQL Programmer/Data Engineer persona about the role of Facilitator/Educators** (Jane & Debbie)]
- [addition of his own understanding from **Sim UI Designer/Developer** (James) persona about linking out to files].
- Well, **Sim UI Designer/Developer** (James), thatʼs not quite what I heard **SQL Programmer/Data Engineer** (Ash) saying either, I think we might be starting to **_fragment out in our shared understanding of the how._**”

**Sim UI Designer/Developer** (James):

- “It seems like I never quite understand _you._”

**C.	What do you notice about this exchange?**

- **Lots of personas** involved here...**what do we know about the differences in these personas?**
- **Focus on the WHY for HQ**, represented by PI here, being discussed with team members who arenʼt in that workgroup.
- **Conversation loses shared understanding related to clarifying the HOW** (order of operations, questioning the assumptions of whether we need Actions to solve 80% of HQʼs pain points or whether an App to enforce .md style may suffice for root tasks and pain points.
- **Active listening to elucidate and clarify misunderstandings across persona mental models**, leads a team member to reflect in _my understanding vs. PI understanding_. **What does this feel like, does it feel as fun as a “song?”**
- This type of work is common, and these types of conclusions need to be questioned.

**Pull us back to maintain the safety of our Empathic POV**

- **How do personas help us with this?**
- Clarify mental models/assumptions that need testing.
- Move us to consider “user needs” not just our own.
- **How do MVPs help us with this?**
- “Fail fast & cheap” testing key assumptions before proceeding

**Walk before you run...Really...weʼre just starting to roll our sleeves up to get to the bottom of this...**

- Team PSD members need to take _individual responsibility_ for trying to understand whatʼs really happening at the level of the team learning about each **personaʼs WHYs** and
- Team PSD members need to enlist _individual resourcefulness_ standard language

**Summary of Day 4ʼs Review of TEST Cognitive Interview - Capabilities of the GH CI Protoype:**

- **We have more learning & mental modeling work to do related to our Continuous Integration (CI) HOWs**

**Part III.**

**How do persona tests of MVPs help us reduce risk and start using Standard Language (note: not shared...universally standard)?**

**A. What is the purpose of an MVP?**

**Reduce risk** while you increase return on investment (for team time spent) **by building only what is necessary.**

**B. How do you define whatʼs necessary?**

"What is necessary" means the smallest possible version (prototype) that can be **_used to run a meaningful experiment to test key hypotheses_** and determine whether to continue investment.

**_Overview - How/Why**

**First, clarify our assumptions about our user personas._**

**_Second, use how/why laddering_ to determine our “how might we” MVPs to _test our hypotheses_.**

- **Why do this?**
- **How should we do this?**

**C. Using your own user persona, edit the key example MVP hypotheses to your _persona._**

**Example 1:**

- How does this **workgroup** work together now (people, platforms & processes)?
- **Why do we assume** that it works this way?
- We will assess this by reviewing my **_one page LucidCharts map of my Workgroup_** (see Lindseyʼs examples)

**Example 2:**

- How does this **workgroup** interface with Team PSD now (people, platforms & processes)?
- **Why do we assume** that it works this way?
- We will assess this by reviewing my **_one page LucidCharts map of Team PSD_** (see Lindseyʼs examples)

***INTEGRATE IF YOU CAN.**

**_First, clarify our assumptions about our MVPs._**

**D. How Team PSD/Workgroup/Persona would use it definitions (yes, look it up, but answer according to your user persona). Standard Language: What else should be on this list?**

- **App**
- **Action**
- **API**
- **Webhook**
- **Git**
- **LucidCharts**
- **YAML**
- **.md**
- **CSS**
- **repo**
- **branch**
- **style**
- **continuous integration**
- **continuous deployment**
- **documentation**
- **root directory**

**E. _Prototype Review: Review the GitHub Apps and the GitHub Actions._**

**Using your own user persona, edit the key example MVP hypotheses to your _persona_.**

**_How Team PSD/Workgroup/Persona would use it_ definitions (yes, look it up, but answer according to your user persona).**
 
**Using your own user persona, edit the example MVP (GH App & Action) hypotheses to your _persona_.**

**Example 3:**

- **How might we do X?**
- **Why do we assume** it will it solve 80% of my user personaʼs pain points?
- We will assess this by developing ____ & measuring ____?

**Example 4:**

- How might my user persona **learn** to work this way?
- **Why do we assume** they need to learn it to solve 80% of their pain points?
- We will assess this by developing ____& measuring ____.

**F. How would you develop user-centered hypotheses for the Apps or Actions you selected?**

**Keys for our User-Centered MVP hypotheses:**

1. Aligned with our major goal to implement our most solve our **scaling pain points.**
2. An MVP is built **with minimal time investment and features, focused on a viable solution.**
It's the foundation upon which to iterate.

**G. Map your understanding functionality requirements of #1192 & #1220 to personas and MVPs.**

**First, identify our assumptions (use your cognitive Interview results) and write hypotheses to test them.**

- What exactly is the **smallest thing that we can build to test this hypothesis?**
- What else might we need to know to test this hypothesis and **reduce risk?**

**_The metric we select, will help us to learn whether our design and learning plan is going the right direction_.**

**Part V: AFTERNOON TOGETHER**

**Synthesize**

**Refine plans for divvying up learning and set up tasks to implement Team PSD-specific prototypes for user-testing next week.**

- Weʼll use our Personas to develop Team PSD-specific Tests
- But first, we need to be able to talk to one another in the language of continuous integration.

**Maps as Prototypes**

**Repo map**order of priorities:

- Team PSD Open Science **disseminate** scientists & VA???
- **mtl_code** plus OSF (research scientists?)
- **Internal VA Enterprise** (operations VA)
- **teampsd** - set up SOP build for repo

**Need HQ to set up quickly to effectively engage Jane & Debbie (1192)**

- **Everything Team PSD** - team **document** how to “teampsd” (1192) - 100% “living document” and “self-help”

**With help from Forio & Dev:**

- **Everything MTL “mtl” describe, detail** (Sim UI, SEE & SAY, Models, model & data documentarian) (1220) - 100% open source (get the help!)

**What is the purpose of an MVP?**

**Reduce risk** while you increase return on investment (for team time spent) **by building only what is necessary.**

**How do you define whatʼs necessary?**

"What is necessary" means the smallest possible version (prototype) that can be **_used to run a meaningful experiment to test key hypotheses_** and determine whether to continue investment.

**_First, clarify our assumptions about our user personas (HOW/WHY)_**

**_Second, identify our assumptions and write hypotheses to test them (HOW/ WHY)_.**

- What exactly is the **smallest thing that we can build to test this hypothesis?**
- What else might we need to know to test this hypothesis and **reduce risk?**

**B. Review the May Epic R21 and 1192 & 1220 goals and Sorted List of Open Issues**

- **What we should strive to fully implement in May to get the highest yield improvements in Team PSD workflow.**
- **Where is the biggest bang for your userʼs [motivational] buck?**

**C. Which workflow should we set up/implement first** (adds the most value, improves the most downstream; analogy our root level directory)?

- Why is that the most important workflow to set up first?
- Why would it save the most time in May?
- Why would it save the most effort in general (typical day)?
- What paint points does it address?
- What part of the SOP/Manual/Document tracker does it address?
- Is it “root” enough to avoid rework?
- What are the downstream benefits of starting with this?
- What are the risks of starting with this?

**D. How might we set up that workflow? Who needs to learn what?**

- Plans for learning by user-type/workgroup based on the highest yield (for lightest lift):
- What is standard and can we learn it using existing trainings online?
- What needs to be sorted out next to integrate this into Team PSD?
