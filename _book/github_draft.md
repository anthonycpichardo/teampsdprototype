## Style
We use R Markdown format for syntax and style which you can refer to here (ADD HYPERLINK). Use a human and computer readable format to name files, meaning all lowercase, underscores, and dates (as necesary) with a name that will be meaningful to whoever reads it. 

We will update with links to style guides.
